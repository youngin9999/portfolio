We need to find a better solution here . 
We have to identify the areas where improvements can be made . 
Right now , the approach is to theordtically find the minimum number of vehecles first ,
and then optimize the total distance cost based on that .
But im not sure where exactly we can improve.
We need to identify potential areas for improvement,
since the competition deadline is approaching 




+ We fine the issue .
There are three types of boxes .
and we curretly classify vehicles into multiple types to determine the minimum nmber of vehicles needed .
however , the number of types-0 boxes that can be loaded into vehicles capacle of carrying type-0 boxes is significantly higher than the number of boxes of other types .
Every multiple of 84 makes it easier for these vehicels to load type-0 boxes ,
but since 84 is large number , it seems that if we introduce more vehicle type that can a smaller number of type-0 boxes ,
we could achieve a more optimal solution .
